Key Additions:
MD5 Checksum Generation:

The generateMD5() function fetches the most recently flashed binary file, computes its MD5 checksum using the CryptoJS library, and displays it on the page.
Drag-and-Drop Area:

A div with the ID drop-area allows users to drag and drop a binary file for comparison.
The drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using event listeners for dragover, dragleave, and drop.
Checksum Comparison:

When a file is dropped, its MD5 checksum is computed and compared to the last flashed checksum. The result is displayed in the comparisonResult paragraph.
Usage:
After a successful OTA update, the user can click the "Generate MD5 Checksum" button to generate and display the checksum of the most recently flashed binary file.
Users can drag and drop a binary file into the designated area to check if it matches the checksum of the last flashed file.
